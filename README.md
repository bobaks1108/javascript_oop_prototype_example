This is an example of using  Javascript prototypes and d3js â€“ to draw and then to describe a simple rectangle to illustrate the power of creating objects using Prototypes.

All JavaScript objects have a prototype which they inherit their properties and methods from.

E.G. Objects created with new Date() inherit the Date.prototype.

This example illustrates how to use Javascript Prototypes to create an object and set our own properties and create our own custom methods.
